# nand2tetris

This repository contains source code implentations for, and files needed to compile and run, projects from the first edition of [*The Elements of Computing Systems*](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). For those unfamiliar, it is a sequence of projects starting from the lowly the NAND gate, proceeding up the computing stack till operating systems, where the reader implements a computer and its various software systems.

## Contents ##

### Project 1: Boolean Logic ###

This project contains combinational circuits needed to build the computer system. It uses a NAND gate as a primitive building block. Introduced here are the HDL (hardware descriptor language) and TSL (test scripting language).

### Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic ###

Proceeding forward, this project enails building circuits capable of doing basic 2's complement arithmetic, such as an adder or ALU.

### Project 3: Sequential Logic ###

Using data flip-flops as a primitive, this project requires building sequential circuits such as, registers and memory. The simulator simulates a clock.

### Project 4: Machine Language ###

Hitherto, every project was digital design. This project is a preview of writing assembly language programs to motivate the architecture of the computer. Introduced here are the Hack assembler and the CPU simulator.

### Project 5: Computer Architecture ###

This capstone hardware project consisted of putting together all the circuits to build the Hack computer, consisting of RAM, ROM and CPU. I/O is memory mapped.

### Other projects ###
